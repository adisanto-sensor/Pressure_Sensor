# SMI Pressure_Sensor
Arduino PyMata Sensor Project 
Alpha Release of Pressure sensor via I2C UNO board using Pymata and Firmata Plus coupled to Python.  
Just some reads to sensor to get at internal registers and operating modes. 
12/23/2019 added simple i2c write to gain access to NCM
04/17/2020  Added a bunch new functions to read SMI pressure sensor.  
Added CRC to user and cal area
Added pressure and temp graphs.
